            <p>Kyudo is an elegant, ceremonial, non-combative method of shooting the traditional Japanese bow and arrow. Kyudo requires, and therefore develops, a balanced body that works in concert with a peaceful mind.</p>

            <p>Kyudo, literally "the Way (or Path) of the Bow", is a path that takes a lifetime to travel. Early progress in the basic forms of Kyudo soon give way to deeper insights into specific details. Each successive insight leads the student to a greater appreciation of the depth, subtlety and sincerity of the Kyudo experience.</p>

            <p>One of Japan's oldest and purest martial arts, today Kyudo is practiced by men and women throughout the world.</p>
